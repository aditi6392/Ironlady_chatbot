# Iron Lady Chatbot

This is my submission for the **AI & Technology Intern (EdTech) – Technical Task** at Iron Lady.  

I built a simple chatbot that answers questions about **Iron Lady leadership programs**. For any other questions, it uses the **Google Gemini API** to provide intelligent responses, but always in the context of Iron Lady programs and leadership.
